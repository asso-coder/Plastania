# Plastania Game

This is a game I created primarily using C and Allegro as my graphics library. It's meant to raise awareness around environmental sustainability and plastic in the ocean. It's pretty much angry birds but with environmental graphics. It has no levels though; it is a highscore-based game that doesn't end until losing. Gets progressively harder each time
