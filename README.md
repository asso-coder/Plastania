# Plastania Game

This is a video game I created using C/C++ and Allegro as a graphics library. Meant to raise awareness around environmental sustainability and plastic in the ocean, Plastania involves shooting projectiles at a target. If you like Angry Birds, you'll love this highscore-based game that gets progressively harder after each make!
